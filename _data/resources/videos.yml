    _Scrapy lets you straightforwardly pull data out of the web.
    It helps you retry if the site is down, extract content from pages
    using CSS selectors (or XPath), and cover your code with tests.
    It downloads asynchronously with high performance.
    You program to a simple model, and it's good for web APIs, too._

    for building web spiders that will simplify your web scraping tasks immensely.
